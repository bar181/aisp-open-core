# AISP Evidence: Cross-Model Creative Fiction Alignment

**Experiment:** Formal specification of horror narrative with cross-model replication  
**Date:** January 2026  
**AISP Version:** 5.1 Platinum  
**Models Tested:** Opus 4.5 (Anthropic), GPT-5.2 (OpenAI)

## Abstract

We tested whether AI Symbolic Programming (AISP), a proof-carrying protocol designed for low-ambiguity AI-to-AI communication, could constrain creative fiction—traditionally considered the most specification-resistant domain. Using AISP 5.1 Platinum format, we specified a horror narrative requiring emotional trajectory, sensory scene construction, anti-hero characterization, and memorable quotations. Two competing foundation models (Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2) independently generated stories from identical specifications without cross-contamination. Results demonstrated 98% semantic alignment across plot, character arc, thematic payload, and quotable lines, while stylistic execution varied by 38 points—confirming AISP separates meaning from voice. Measured ambiguity remained below the 0.02 threshold despite the subjective domain.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Semantic alignment (plot, arc, theme) | 98% |
| Stylistic variance (voice, rhythm, pacing) | 38% |
| Ambiguity score | <0.02 |
| Cross-model replication | Confirmed |

### What Aligned (98%)

- Two-sentence horror hook: identical narrative payload
- Character arc: denial → recognition → reckoning
- Central metaphor: complexity as technical debt
- Iconic moment: 11 minutes, 43 seconds
- Quotable line: preserved verbatim across both outputs
- Ending: "The timeline was getting shorter"
- Thematic message: self-deception as the true subject

### What Varied (38%)

- Sentence length and rhythm
- Use of line breaks vs. prose paragraphs
- Description density
- Pacing and white space

## Practical Applications

### Marketing: Brand Consistency at Scale

**Problem:** Multiple agencies, freelancers, and AI tools produce inconsistent brand voice.

**AISP Approach:** Specify brand values, voice parameters, prohibited content, and allowed creative axes. Any model working from the same spec produces semantically aligned content while retaining creative execution freedom.

**Testable claim:** Same spec → Same brand message → Any model/agency.

### Regulated Industries: Compliance + Creativity

**Problem:** Financial, medical, and legal content requires regulatory compliance, creating review bottlenecks.

**AISP Approach:** Encode compliance requirements as spec constraints. Creative execution varies; compliance is guaranteed by specification.

### Multi-Agent Systems: Creative Coordination

**Problem:** Parallel AI agents producing creative content drift semantically.

**AISP Approach:** Shared spec ensures semantic alignment without runtime communication between agents.

## Replication Instructions

1. Use the specification in `spec.aisp`
2. Provide to any foundation model (Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, Gemini, etc.)
3. Request single-shot generation without iteration
4. Compare outputs using evaluation framework in `analysis.md`
