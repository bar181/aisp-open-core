# Tic-Tac-Toe Comparative Analysis

> **Status:** Placeholder — Full analysis data coming soon

This document contains the empirical comparison between natural language specifications and AISP for implementing Tic-Tac-Toe.

**Key findings:**
- **Ambiguities:** 6 (prose) → 0 (AISP) = 100% reduction
- **Technical Precision:** 43/100 (prose) → 95/100 (AISP) = +121%
- **Implementation Adherence:** 85/100 → 94/100 = +11%

**Coming soon:**
- Full prose specification used in test
- Full AISP specification used in test
- Side-by-side implementation outputs
- Evaluator scoring rubrics and methodology
